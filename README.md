# What is this?
This is the reposity of my Machine Learning class ( or more precisely, 
a discussion gruop) at Physics Departmant, UC Davis. Each 
week I will introduce several topics (keyword notes can be found in
the note folder) about machine learning in my class
and discuss a few codes based on Tensoflow, Keras or Scikit learn with 
people in my class. Stay tuned! 

* Scheduled Topics (update weekly):
week 1: introduction to machine
week 2: basic tensorflow
week 3: visualize tensorflow, tensorboard

* Tutorial Codes:
code01_x.py : show how to install necessary packages
code02_x.py : supervised, regression fitting of arbitary curves
code03_x.py : show how to use tensorboard to visualize your code
