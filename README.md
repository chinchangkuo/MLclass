# What is this?
This is the reposity of my Machine Learning course ( or more precisely, 
a discussion gruop) at Physics Department, UC Davis. Each 
week I will introduce several topics, from beginning to advanced, about 
machine learning techniqes. Keyword notes and lecture slides can be found 
in the note/slide folders.      

Each week I will also prepare a few codes to explain what we have learned 
in the class. Most codes are based on Google's tensorflow, but Keras 
and Scikit learn will also included in the future.      

This course doesn't aim to teach you all the theories about machine learning, 
but just a quick hands-on for people who want to use machine learning as a 
tool to deal with real problems. If you have further questions, please email
to spi@ucdavis.edu or visit our facebook pages for discussion.
