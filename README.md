# What is this?
This is the reposity of my Machine Learning course ( or more precisely, 
a discussion gruop) at Physics Departmant, UC Davis. Each 
week I will introduce several topics, from beginning to advanced, about 
machine learning techniqes. Keyword notes can be found in the note folder.
I will also prepare a few codes to explain what we have learned in the 
class. Most codes are based on Google's tensorflow, but Keras and Scikit 
learn will also included in the future. 

This course doesn't aim to teach you all the theories about machine learning, 
but just a quick hands-on for people who want to use machine learning to deal
with real life problem. If you have further questions, you can go to our
facebook pages for discussion. 

* Scheduled Topics (update weekly):
    week 1: introduction to machine learning
    week 2: introduction to tensorflow
    week 3: visualize tensorflow via tensorboard

* Tutorial Codes:
    code01_x.py : show how to install necessary packages
    code02_x.py : supervised, regression fitting of arbitary curves
    code03_x.py : show how to use tensorboard to visualize your code
