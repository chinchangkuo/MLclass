code01_ex1: 
show how to install all packages

code02_ex1_v1 (MLP regression) 
show to to construct a fully connected NN to perform
regression fitting on arbitary curves + noises

code02_ex1_v2 (MLP regression)
same as v1, but add batch set to training. 

code02_ex1_v3 (MLP regression)
same as v2, but use tf.layer.dense to construct layers

code03_ex1_v1 (Tensorboard)
show how to use tensorboar to visualize computation graph

code03_ex1_v2 (Tensorboard)
same as v1, but include tensorboar visuzlization on 
other information. 

code03_ex2_v1 (point data classification)
generate several data around some centers with noises and
show how to perform classification using fully connected NN.
concepts of softmax and cross entropy are emphasized. 

code04_ex1_v1 (MINST classification)
show how to plot MINST figures.

code04_ex1_v2 (MINST classification)
show how to construct a fully connected NN to regonize 
MINST data, i.e. supervised classification.
